# odin-recipes

This is my first HTML and CSS project. FIrst I'll start off with the HTML side of the house and then further down the line add my CSS elements. This project will be a simple recipes directory with a few recipes layed out across the webpage with each recipe having their own page. Each page should have a link that works, lists of ingredients, directions and pictures included.
